# Dentist app

This is a simple Web app for dentist lab, currently on localhost. There are option for registration and insertion.

To see all the features of this Web app, you can download the files and locally host it. (e.g. download files into htdocs folder of Xampp and create database with the same name as defined in code).

I used Php for making login system and Sql for relational database. HTML/CSS, Bootstrap for design.
